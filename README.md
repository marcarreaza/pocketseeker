# PocketSeeker: A ligand binding site predictor for proteins

## 📌 Project Description

PocketSeeker is a bioinformatics tool designed to predict the binding site residues of a protein using machine learning techniques. The core of the application is a Random Forest classifier trained on structural and sequence-based features extracted from protein data. Given a protein structure in PDB format or a PDB ID, PocketSeeker analyzes each residue and determines its likelihood of being part of a binding site.

This tool aims to assist researchers in identifying potential functional regions of proteins, which can be crucial for tasks such as drug design, protein engineering, or functional annotation.




## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To get started with PocketSeeker, follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the PocketSeeker repository using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/marcarreaza/pocketseeker.git
cd pocketseeker
```

### 2. Run the setup script
Execute the provided setup script to create and configure the Conda environment:
```
bash setup.sh
```

This script automatically creates a Conda environment named pocketseeker with all required dependencies. It detects whether the system is running on Linux or macOS and installs the appropriate binaries and tools accordingly.

### 3. Activate the environment
Once the setup is complete, activate the environment manually:
```
conda activate pocketseeker
```

### 4. (Optional) Add PocketSeeker to your system PATH
To run pocketseeker.py from any location as a command-line tool, you can add the project folder to your system PATH. For example:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/pocketseeker
```

Replace `/path/to/pocketseeker` with the absolute path to the cloned repository. You can also add this line to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent shell config file to make it permanent.




## ️🔎 How pocketseeker.py Works

pocketseeker.py is the main script of the PocketSeeker application. It provides multiple execution modes depending on the input type and desired output behavior. Below is a summary of the most common usage options:

### 1. Analyze a single PDB file
```
python3 pocketseeker.py protein.pdb
```
Analyzes the provided PDB file and creates a folder called `results/` (if it doesn't exist) in the current working directory. Two files are generated:

- `binding_sites_predictions.csv`: CSV matrix with residue-wise binding site predictions.
- `modified_{file_basename}.pdb`: A modified PDB file with predicted binding residues marked for visualization.

### 2. Visualize results directly in UCSF Chimera
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -ch protein.pdb
```
After analysis, opens UCSF Chimera to visualize the structure with the predicted binding sites highlighted.

***Note:*** This only works when analyzing single files.

### 3. Analyze all PDB files in a directory
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -d path/to/directory
```
Scans the specified folder for .pdb files and processes them one by one. Each result is saved in `results/{file_basename}/`.

### 4. Analyze multiple local PDB files
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -local_many protein1.pdb protein2.pdb ...
```
Processes each PDB file listed and stores the outputs separately in `results/{file_basename}/` for each input.

### 5. Download and analyze a protein from the PDB Bank
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -online PDB_ID
```
Downloads the structure of the specified PDB ID from the Protein Data Bank, runs the analysis, and saves the output in the `results/` directory.

### 6. Analyze multiple proteins from the PDB Bank
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -online_many PDB_ID1 PDB_ID2 ...
```
Downloads and analyzes each of the listed PDB IDs. Each result is stored in `results/{PDB_ID}/`.

### 7. Specify a custom output directory
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -o output/
```
Use this option to override the default output location (`results/`) with a custom folder path.

### 8. Use a custom machine learning model
```
python3 pocketseeker.py -model custom_model.joblib
```
Allows the user to specify a custom Random Forest model (in `.joblib` format) instead of using the default pre-trained model included in the repository.
