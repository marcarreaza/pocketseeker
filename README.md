# PocketSeeker: A ligand binding site predictor for proteins

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

PocketSeeker is a bioinformatics tool designed to predict the binding site residues of a protein using machine learning techniques. The core of the application is a Random Forest classifier trained on structural and sequence-based features extracted from protein data. Given a protein structure in PDB format or a UniProt ID, PocketSeeker analyzes each residue and determines its likelihood of being part of a binding site.

This tool aims to assist researchers in identifying potential functional regions of proteins, which can be crucial for tasks such as drug design, protein engineering, or functional annotation.
